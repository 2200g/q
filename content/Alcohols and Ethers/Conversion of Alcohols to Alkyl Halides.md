> Since the hydroxyl group is a poor leaving group, it is first converted into a group that can depart as a weak base.

> These processes begin by reaction of alcohol oxygen as a base or nucleophile, after which the modified oxygen group undergoes substitution.

Commonly used reagents:
- Hydrogen Halides (Halogen Acids) ($HX$)
- Phosphorus Tribromide ($PBr_3$)
- Thionyl Chloride ($SOCl_2$)

> Alcohols react with strong acidic hydrogen halides but they do not react with non acidic sodium halides. Primary and Secondary alcohols can be converted into alkyl chlorides and alkyl bromides by allowing them to react with a mixture of a sodium halide and sulfuric acid.![[Pasted image 20240801113141.png]]

- $HBr$ and $HI$ are generally generated by $KBr + H_2SO_4$ and $KI + H_3PO_4$ respectively. 
## Non-primary alcohols.
They appear to react by a mechanism that involves the formation of a carbocation. The mechanism is similar to that of dehydration. (Rearrangements are expected c:)

-> (Steps 1 and 2) (Same as dehydration.)
1. The hydroxyl group is protonated by a hydronium ion.
2. The protonated hydroxyl group ($-O^+H_2$), being a good leaving group, departs to form a carbocation and water.
-> (Step 3)
- Here the point of difference comes in between dehydration of alcohol and formation of an alkyl halide from an alcohol.
	- Dehydration of Alcohol:
	  It is done at high temperatures and in presence of concentrated $H_2SO_4$. After the protonation of the hydroxyl group, $HSO_4^-$ is formed, which is a bad nucleophile. At high temperatures the highly reactive carbocation forms a more stable product in the form of alkene, which being volatile, distills from the reaction mixture as its being formed, causing the reaction equilibrium to shift towards alkene formation -> Resultant mechanism is $E1$.
	  In some instances the carbocation also reacts with $HSO_4^-$ or sulfuric acid itself. Here they form alkyl hydrogen sulfates ($R-OSO_2OH$)

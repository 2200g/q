- Oxygen atom of Hydroxyl group
	- Weakly Basic (Due to lone-pairs.)
	- Nucleophilic
- Hydrogen atom of Hydroxyl group
	- Weakly Acidic
- Upon protonation it converts into a good leaving group ($-H_2O$) from a poor one ($-OH$). Protonation also causes the carbon to be even more positive due to the higher electron withdrawing nature of ($H_2O^+-$). This makes it even more susceptible to nucleophilic attacks.
- At a high enough temperature and in absence of a good nucleophile, protonated alcohols are capable of undergoing $E1$ and $E2$ reactions. (Alcohol dehydrations.)

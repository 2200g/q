> Most alcohols undergo dehydration to form alkenes, when heated with a strong acid. -> Elimination reaction.

(Difficulty in dehydration) 1$\degree$ > 2$\degree$ > 3$\degree$.
-> This is due to stabilization of carbocation.
(Rearrangement is possible.)
- Secondary and Tertiary alcohols generally undergo $E1$.
- Primary alcohols generally undergo $E2$.
# Dehydration of Secondary and Tertiary alcohols.
The mechanism is an $E1$ reaction wherein the substrate is a protonated alcohol.
-> (Step 1)
- The hydroxyl group is protonated (generally happens quickly) by a hydronium ion (or any other acid catalyst.)

- This causes the formation of a very strong electron withdrawing group, $-O^+H_2$.
-> (Step 2)
- The C-O bond, weakened due to the electron withdrawing nature, breaks heterolytically. This forms a carbocation and is the rate determining step.

- (Formation of carbocation generally always is the rate determining step.) Hence it is this step that determines the overall reactivity of alcohols toward dehydration. Since a 1$\degree$ or a 0$\degree$ carbocation is not stable (hyperconjugation), their corresponding alcohols are extremely difficult to dehydrate in this manner. (Free energies of activation for the formation of carbocations from protonated alcohols: tertiary < secondary << primary.)
-> (Step 3)
- A water molecule removes a proton from the $\beta$-carbon of the carbocation. (When removing this $\beta$-Hydrogen keep in mind the number of $\alpha$-Hydrogens of the resultant double bond.)

# Dehydration of Primary alcohols.
Since $E1$ mechanism for primary alcohols is relatively unstable, dehydration proceeds through $E2$ mechanism.
- The first step proceeds like that of $E1$ and the hydroxyl group gets protonated.

- Then with $-O^+H_2$ being a good leaving group, a Lewis base in the reaction mixture removes  a $\beta$-Hydrogen simultaneously with the formation of double bond and the departure of the protonated hydroxyl group.

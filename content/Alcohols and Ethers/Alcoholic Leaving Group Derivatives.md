Upon conversion to a sulfonate ester derivative, the hydroxyl group can be a good leaving group.
- Methanesulfonate Esters (mesylates)
- p-Toluenesulfonate Esters (tosylates)
- Trifluoromethanesulfonate Esters (triflates)

They are usually prepared by the reaction of the alcohol in pyridine with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride.
- This reaction does not affect the stereochemistry of the alcoholic carbon --> retention of configuration.
They are often used as substrates for nucleophilic substitution. They are good leaving groups as the sulfonate ions they become when they depart are very weak bases.

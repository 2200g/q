- Boiling Point of ether is comparable with that of a hydrocarbon of same molecular mass.
- Alcohols have much higher boiling points than comparable ethers or hydrocarbons.
> (This is due to alcohols being capable of forming strong hydrogen bonding.)
- Alcohols can H-bond with each other whereas ethers can not. Ether's however can H-bond with water molecules.
> (Hence, ethers have solubilites in water that are similar to those of alcohols of the same molecular weight, and that are very different from those of hydrocarbons.)

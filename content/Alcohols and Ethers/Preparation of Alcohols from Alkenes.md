| Atom | Attached to | Origin       |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ |
| H    | C           | Solvent/Acid |
| O    | C           | Solvent      |
| H    | O           | Solvent      |
- These reactions follow [[Markovnikov's Rule]]. And thus, are unable to produce primary alcohols except in the special case of hydration of ethene, and are reversible.
- In the case of ethene a primary alcohol (Ethanol) is formed, when ethene is treated with $H^+$ at 300$\degree$C, and high pressure.
- It is the reverse case of dehydration of an alcohol.
- The rate determining step is the formation of carbocation.
- Rearrangement is possible due to carbocation formation.
- Not generally used to synthesize alcohols due to rearrangements causing isomeric alcohol products to form.
# Oxymercuration-Demercuration

![[Pasted image 20240731161058.png]]

| Atom | Attached to | Origin             |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| H    | C           | Hydride ($NaBH_4$) |
| H    | O           | Added Water        |
| O    | C           | Added Water        |
- Rearrangements rarely take place (No carbocation is formed.)
- As per SHAB principles,
	- An electrophilic attack by the mercury specimen $Hg^+OAc$ at the less substituted carbon atom. (It later is replaced by $H$.)
	- $OH^-$ is added to the more congested site.
	- $H^+$ is added to the less congested site.
	- This is in accordance with [[Markovnikov's Rule]].
		- The H- becomes attached to the carbon with greater number of Hydrogen atoms.
- The first step is anti.
- Both steps (1->3 is Oxymercuration and 4 is Demercuration) occur in the same vessel.
	- Oxymercuration ~ Few seconds - Few Minutes
	- Demercuration ~ Less than an hour.
- High yield of alcohol ~>= 90%.
> In case an alkene is treated with mercuric trifluoroacetate, $Hg(O_2CCF_3)_2$, in $THF$ containing an alcohol, $ROH$, the product is an (alkoxyalkyl)mercury compound. Treating this product with $NaBH_4 / HO^-$ results in the formation of an ether.
> This process is called **solvomercuration-demercuration**.

# Hydroboration-Oxidation

![[Pasted image 20240731182033.png]]

| Atom | Attached to | Origin   |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| H    | O           | Solvent  |
| H    | C           | Diborane |
| O    | C           | Peroxide |
- Hydroboration-Oxidation can be achieved through the use of diborane ($B_2H_6$) or ($BH_3:THF$) a solution of borane in $THF$.
- The first step is Hydroboration and the second Oxidation.
- [[Anti-Markovnikov]] Regioselectivity is followed,
	- $OH^-$ is attached to the less congested site. (This was where $R-$ was attached to $BR_2$ from initially before oxidation.)
	- $H^+$ is attached to the more congested site. (Carbon with lesser number of hydrogens.)
- Hydroboration reactions are carried out in ethers: either in diethyl ether ($(CH_3CH_2)_2O$) or in some higher molecular weight ether such as "diglyme" ($(CH_3OCH_2CH_2)_2O$, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether.) 
- Diborane and alkyl-boranes ignite spontaneously in air (with a green flame.) Hence the solution of $BH_3:THF$ must be used in inert atmosphere and with care.
- Both electronic and steric factors account for the anti-Markovnikov orientation of addition.
	- The bulky boron-containing group can approach less substituted carbon atom more easily.
	- As the 4-membered transition state approaches, electrons shift in the direction of the boron atom and away from the  more substituted atom, causing the more substituted carbon atom develop a partial positive charge. Since the carbon atom is more substituted, it is better able to accommodate the positive charge.

-  Hydroboration requires the addition of $H-$ and $-BH_2$ to the same face, causing Syn addition.
- Oxidation of the alkylborane is regioselective and is anti-markvonikov specific.
- Hydroboration-Oxidation is stereospecific and Syn.

> In chemistry, a **nucleofuge** (from _nucleo-_ atomic nucleus and _fuge_ 'to run away/escape') is a leaving group which retains the lone pair of electrons from its previous bond with another species. 

Nucleofugality: Leaving group tendency.

- Leaving groups that are neutral after departure are better than leaving groups that are charged after departure.
- Among charged leaving groups, resonance stabilized ones are better.
- For a leaving group that is negatively charged after departure, nucleofugality incerases with the capability of retaining the $-ve$ charge.
	- In a given period, nucleofugality increases with increase in electronegativity. (Hence, it also increases with increase in $S$-Character.)
	- In a given period, nucleofugality increases with increase in atomic volume.
	- Nucleofugality increases with the presence of [[Electron Withdrawing Group]].

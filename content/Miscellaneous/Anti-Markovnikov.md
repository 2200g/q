Also called **Kharasch effect** (named after [Morris S. Kharasch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_S._Kharasch "Morris S. Kharasch")), these reactions that do not involve a [carbocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbocation "Carbocation") intermediate may react through other mechanisms that have [regioselectivities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regioselectivity "Regioselectivity") not dictated by Markovnikov's rule, such as [free radical addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_radical_addition "Free radical addition"). Such reactions are said to be **anti-Markovnikov**, since the halogen adds to the less substituted carbon, the opposite of a Markovnikov reaction.

The anti-Markovnikov rule can be illustrated using the addition of [hydrogen bromide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bromide "Hydrogen bromide") to isobutylene in the presence of benzoyl peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of HBr with substituted alkenes was prototypical in the study of free-radical additions. Early chemists discovered that the reason for the variability in the ratio of Markovnikov to anti-Markovnikov reaction products was due to the unexpected presence of free radical ionizing substances such as peroxides. The explanation is that the O-O bond in peroxides is relatively weak. With the aid of light, heat, or sometimes even just acting on its own, the O-O bond can split to form 2 [radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)"). The radical groups can then interact with HBr to produce a Br radical, which then reacts with the double bond. Since the bromine atom is relatively large, it is more likely to encounter and react with the least substituted carbon since this interaction produces less static interactions between the carbon and the bromine radical. Furthermore, similar to a positive charged species, the radical species is most stable when the unpaired electron is in the more substituted position. The radical intermediate is stabilized by [hyperconjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperconjugation "Hyperconjugation"). In the more substituted position, more carbon-hydrogen bonds are aligned with the radical's electron deficient molecular orbital. This means that there are greater hyperconjugation effects, so that position is more favorable.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markovnikov%27s_rule#cite_note-5) In this case, the terminal carbon is a reactant that produces a primary addition product instead of a secondary addition product.

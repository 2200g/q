## Catalytic Hydrogenation

> Hydrogenation reactions that involve insoluble catalysts --> heterogeneous catalysis. ($Ni$, $Pd$, $Pt$)
> Hydrogenation reactions that involve soluble catalysts --> homogeneous catalysis. ($Rh[(C_6H_5)_3P]_3Cl$ - Wilkinson's catalyst.)

Unsaturated compounds can be reduced to saturated compounds by catalytic hydrogenation.

- Support is used to prevent the catalyst from destroying its catalytic activity.

## Hydroboration Reduction or Dimerisation

- Syn-addition.
- Boron is added to that carbon which is less sterically hindered.

## Wurtz Reaction

> Formation of higher alkanes from alkyl halides in the presence of sodium and dry ether is named Wurtz reaction.
> It can proceed with ionic as well as radical mechanisms.

> Disproportionation products can also be formed. 
> Cyclic products can also be formed.

> If the substrate is tertiary, addition reaction is not preferred due to the bulky nature (steric hindrance.)
> Instead, the disproportionation reaction becomes exclusive.

## Reduction with Metal Hydride
![[Pasted image 20240803201706.png]]

| Metal Hydride     | 1$\degree$ | 2$\degree$ | 3$\degree$ |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| LAH / $THF$       | Y          | Alkene     | Alkene     |
| $NaBH_4$ / $ROH$  | N          | Y          | Y          |
| $Ph_3SnH$ / $THF$ | Y          | Y          | Y          |
- Y -> $H^-$ acts as a nucleophile and substitution takes place.
- Alkene -> $H^-$ acts as a base and elimination might take place.
- N -> No reaction.

> LAH -> provides $H^-$ in higher concentrations, so for reactive substances it starts acting as a base.
> $NaBH_4$ -> Due to the high covalent nature of $BH_4^-$ bonds, reactions fail to take place for primary alkylhalides.

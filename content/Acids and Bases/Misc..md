- Curved arrows are always Source --> Sink
- Curved arrows represent the movement of electrons. Never atoms.

- Acid-Base reactions always favor the formation of weaker acids and bases, since they are under equilibrium control. 

 The larger the difference of $pK_a$ in the resultant acid and the initial acid (with the resultant's being lower) (i.e if   $\Delta$ $pK_a$ is more negative) the position of equilibrium will greatly favor the formation of products.

> "The extent to which an acid transfers proton to a base, is a measure of its strength as an Acid."

- It is the measure of the %age of ionization and not concentration.
- A larger value of $K_a$ signifies a stronger acid.
$$ K_{a} = \frac{[H_3O^+][A^-]}{[HA]}  $$
- A larger value of $pK_a$ signifies a weaker acid.
$$ pK_a = -log[K_a] $$
- Stronger the acid, weaker its conjugate base.

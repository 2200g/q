| Mechanism | Substrate                             | Nucleophile/Base               | Leaving Group                         | Solvent        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| $S_N1$    | Tertiary and/or resonance stabilised. | Good Nucleophile,<br>Weak Base | Good leaving group.                   | Polar Protic.  |
| $S_N2$    | Primary or 0$\degree$                 | Good Nucleophile,<br>Weak Base | Good leaving group.                   | Polar Aprotic. |
| $E1$      | Tertiary or resonance stabilised.     | Weaker Base                    | $L_1$ should be a good leaving group. | Polar.         |
| $E2$      | Tertiary or resonance stabilised.     | Stronger Base                  | Good leaving group.                   | Polar Aprotic. |

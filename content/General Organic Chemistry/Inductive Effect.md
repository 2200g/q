> The polarization of bonds due to intrinsic electron-attracting ability of electronegative atoms, that is transmitted through space and through the bonds of the molecule is called Inductive Effect.

- Inductive effects are electronic effects transmitted through bonds. For a group it may be electron donating or electron withdrawing.
- Inductive effects weaken as the distance from the group increases.
